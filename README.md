Simple script that allows you to turn text or background elements into rainbow garbage.

Usage:

For text or anything with the color property, set class as foxrainbow.

For background elements or anything with the background-color property, set class as foxrainbowbg.

To turn it on only when hovering over something, use foxrainbowhover. No background support yet.

You can change the speed and direction of the effect by settings the individual speed variables to be a different number. Negative numbers invert the direction.
