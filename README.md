Simple script that allows you to turn text or background elements into rainbow garbage.

Usage:

For text or anything with the color property, set class as rainbow.

For background elements or anything with the background-color property, set class as rainbowbackground.

You can change the speed and direction of the effect by settings the individual speed variables to be a different number. Negative numbers invert the direction.
